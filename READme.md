# Small Analysis on the rate of growth of Covid-19 cases in India

- Scrapped data from a website which provides data on covid-19 cases of countries around the world.

- Extracted the rows of data concerned to India only.

- Cleaned the data by removing rows where the number of tests performed were missing.

- Used Python packages such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualiztion of data where I compared the total number of cases against date.

NOTE: The analysis are based only on data recorded as of 19<sup>th</sup> April 2020
